HOWTO IRT-model
===============
by Falk Meyer 23.03.2015

This file is intended to give a rough description of the workflow for the
application of RB methods for the IRT model. 

Computations are based on following model: simpleIRT.mph

SETUP
-----

1. Start the comsol to matlab livelink

2. Start a comsol gui, load the model simpleIRT.mph and connect it to the livelink server (/File/Client Server/Connect to Server...)

3. To ensure right Dirichlet-conditions in the python computations, save the dirichlet-values given in the simpleIRT-model under Model1/Definitions/Interpolation1 as dirichlet.csv in the given folder.

4. Be sure about consistensy of given timesteps in dirichlet.csv and the input of endtime T and stepnumber n you want to compute a RB approximation for. I.e. T/n should be the stepsize in the list of dirichletvalues in simpleIRT.mph. 

5. In matlab change the current folder to this one.

6. In matlab load the current comsol model via 

	model = ModelUtil.model('Model2');

   where 'Model2' is to be replaced by the tag of the simpleIRT model on the server/in your gui. You can find the tag when viewing the 'Properties' tab of the overall simpleIRT.mph model.
