# Script to start RB-computations with harddisc data access with matlab
# by Falk Meyer, 12.02.2015

"""startHeatRB

Usage:
  startHeatRB.py [--endtime=TIME] [--steps=STEPS] [--samples=SAMPLES] [--max_extensions=MAX] [--target_error=ERROR]

Arguments:
  None

Options:
  --endtime=TIME	Use TIME as end-time for the instationary problem

  --steps=STEPS		STEPS to be performed during timestepping.

  --samples=SAMPLES	Number of sample parameters, the reduced basis shall be constructed for

  --max_extensions=MAX   MAX number of basis extensions in the reduced basis construction

  --target_error=ERROR  Target error to reach during reduced basis construction
